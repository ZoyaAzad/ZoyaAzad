Hi, I'm Zoya, a 3rd-year Computer Science student at Air University with a passion for building impactful and creative tech projects. I have hands-on experience with C++, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I'm currently focused on advancing my skills in .NET development, an area I have a strong interest in. I enjoy exploring the intersection of technology and creativity, whether it's through web development, mobile apps, or experimental ideas like AI vs Human Intelligence. I'm always on the lookout for new learning opportunities, certifications, internships, and meaningful collaborations that help me grow as a developer. Feel free to reach out at zoyamalik7104@gmail.com. I'm always open to connect and learn.
